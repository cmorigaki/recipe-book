# Recipe Book - My pet project üë∑‚Äç

This app provides a small collection of recipes and their details. Also there is with a few possible settings configuration.

This project is intended to be a case that prioritize a scalable architecture, following good design principles, a codebase that could be maintained by a large number of collaborators/teams. Also, some new approachs may be used as study purpose.

## Tech stack

## Architecture
As we're using 100% kotlin, the project rely all the data flow using kotlin coroutines and flow for reactive.

### Modularization

### Feature layers
Some buzzwords that summarizes the architecture pillars that the app follows:

* MVVM
* Clean architecture
* Dependency inversion
* Dependency injection

### Application layers

1. App
2. Feature
3. Core
4. Utility

### Feature layers

For features, I'm following clean architecture with the corresponding layers:
1. View
2. Presentation
3. Domain
4. Data

## Build Config

### Gradle files

#### Kotlin DSL
For affinity, I'm using kotlin DSL on all gradle files [ref:link]

#### Sync dependency versions
To synchronize dependency versions and avoid string duplications, I'm using a common file that declares dependency versions  as constant referencing them inside build.gradle files.  [ref:link]

#### Reuse build.gradle
In general, features modules have a lot of common dependency. Said that, I'm reusing a base build.gradle files whenever is possible.

#### Proguard
Applying obfuscation and shirink code is a must to build the release version.

## CI/CD

### Framework
I'm using Github actions for CI. Currently, it's still pretty basic...
