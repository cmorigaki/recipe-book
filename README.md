# Recipe Book - My pet project üë∑‚Äç
<img src="misc/screenshots/list_dark.png" width="336" align="right" hspace="20">
This app provides a small collection of recipes and their details. Also, there is a few possible settings configuration.

This project is intended to be a case that prioritize a scalable architecture, following good design principles, a codebase that could be maintained by a large number of collaborators/teams. Also, some new approaches may be used as a study purpose.

## Tech stack
- 100% kotlin
- coroutines
- StateFlow (instead of LiveData)
- Jetpack ViewModel
- View binding
- Koin
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Gradle Groovy
- Github actions

## Architecture
In general, I try to follow SOLID and clean code principles for every piece of code.

### Features
In a feature scope (a screen for this project), the architecture relies on 5 distinct layers: View, Presentation, Domain, Data, Data source. These layers follows a **Clean architecture** dependency that can be represented by the below picture:

</p>

For "view architecture" I'm using MVVM (Jetpack ViewModel), view binding (not DataBinding), kotlin StateFlow instead of LiveData.

### Data flow
Since I'm using 100% kotlin, any asynchronous operation or background work uses kotlin coroutines and Flow when a reactive approach is necessary.
For any SDK integration, I would wrap them using suspendCoroutine/channelFlow to give them a suspend function abstraction over the API calls.

### Navigation
There are some solutions for navigation that have huge impact by modularization.
Today, I have a MainNavigator interface that receives an object that relates to a given screen. The injected list of Navigation resolvers are provided using Koin "multibinding".

### Theme
The application has dark and light mode that can be changed at runtime. All definitions/styles are inside design-system module.

### DI Framework
Koin

## Modularization
The whole application is composed of several modules that are ruled by a hierarchy dependency structure. All modules are classified into a specific module layer and this layer must respect the dependency direction, this is, a given module can only depend on modules of the same layer or below.

### Modules layers
The picture shows the current modules and how they are structured.

</p>

1. **App** - Glue all modules and it has project configurations like build variants, API keys.
2. **Feature** - Product features are developed at this level of modules. For this project I have modules:screen 1:1 but it may vary a lot.
3. **Core** - Here I have modules that are not tied to a specific feature scope but the entire app like Base Classes when needed (I am pretty confident that I keep this layer really small).
4. **Infrastructure** - Modules that compose the foundation of the project. Here we have networking, monitoring, analytics, design-system, navigation.
4. **Utility** - Helpers and extensions classes goes here. But only the ones that are not related to business of the project and it can be reused by other projects.

### Gradle files

#### ~~Kotlin DSL~~
I tried to use gradle kotlin DSL but I've encountered errors when splitting build files for modules reuse.

#### Sync dependency versions
To synchronize dependency versions and avoid string duplications, I'm using a common file that declares dependency versions as constants referencing them inside build.gradle files. [ref:link]

#### Reuse build.gradle
In general, features modules have a lot of common dependency. Said that, I'm reusing a base build.gradle files whenever is possible.

#### Proguard
Applying obfuscation and shrink code is a must for the release build.

## CI/CD

### Framework
I'm using Github actions for CI. Currently, it's still pretty basic...
